<!-- routify:meta order=10 -->


In Routify, every file and folder is a node in a route tree. These nodes are primarily accessed for navigation, but can also be used to retrieve metadata from other pages / modules. 


The navigation for this site is automatically generated by recursively iterating the nodes.


#### Getting the node of the current file
```javascript
  export let context
  const { node } = context
```


#### Iterating the children of a node
```html
{#each node.children as child}        
    <a href={child.path}> {child.name} </a>
{/each}
```

#### Resolving a node
It is also possible to resolve a different node than the current one.
```javascript
  import { resolveNode } from '@roxi/routify'
  const node = resolveNode('../path/to/node')
```
<Example path="../example" title="Resolving nodes" focus="index.svelte" ></Example>

##### Note
A `module.svelte` file is merged into its respective (parent) folder node at buildtime.
